## Hey, I'm Ron

I'm a Software Polyglot 💾 Full Stack SaaS Developer ☁️ e-Commerce Web Designer 🎨 Musician and Dancer! 🎹 who has spent the last 40+ years in the Software Industry. I've worked and dabbled in most areas of technology and software, both legacy and new.

Code wise I started out back in 1981 using BASIC, and progressed to COBOL and used many variations of that. From there I became a Java Developer, and then moved into .NET using C#, VB.NET, classic ASP etc, I then moved into mobile development coding with Android and Apple Objective-C. Also worked with PHP using Laravel and Symfony, and have used Python, a bit of Golang and lots of front end JS frameworks. I've basically done a bunch of stuff 😉

### 💾 About Me

Very much a techie at heart, I’ve been creating software and designing websites since I was a teenager and love inventing and creating tools that people love to use and get real value from.

I also love building Micro-SaaS and side-businesses - helps keep the bank full and the bills paid!

### ⚡ My Github

On my Github you will find lots of fun stuff. I do collect lots of old legacy code, especially vintage gaming software, and I'm also writing some games, both recreating some classic old-skool games but also planning to write some new games. So check out my repos! All a bit of a work in progress so do ping me if you have any questions.
